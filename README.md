# Adults_Dataset
This project is aimed at Predictionn of the Annual salary of Individuals, whether the individual earns Below or above 50K Dollars. 

### Author:

### Business problem:
To help have a view of the performance of the different sectors of employement and self employment and various factors affecting the annual income of an individual.

### Data:
This data was extracted from the census bureau database found at
| http://www.census.gov/ftp/pub/DES/www/welcome.html
aimed to determined whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. Also known as "Census Income" dataset.

1. Consists of the various contributing Factors to the annual Income of a an individual
2. Covers a sample of 32561 entries

### Methods
Data Cleaning

Exploratory Analysis

Five Prediction Models 

### Results

**Distribution of Annual Salary by Gender**

It can be observed that the greatest number of persons earn Below_50k Dollars

## The Random Forest Model

A model has been attached that predicts the persons' annual salary basing on the given features of the individual  basing on the historical data.
The model has been  evaluated on the Metrics
1. Classification Reports
2. Confusion Matrices
3. ROC Curve

### Recommendation.
While there are more models attached, I highly recommend the use of the Random Forest Model on the dataset as it makes prediuctions with a more accurate predictions

### Limitations & Next Steps
The Model is  not 100% accurate however it can be tuned further using the various model hyper parameters to give more accurate predictions.
